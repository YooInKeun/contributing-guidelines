# PAYW Contributing Guidelines

Please follow these guidelines when you are trying to contribute to PAYW software.

## Language

We **_prefer English over Korean_** due to its globally high usage and impact. So it is strongly recommended to use English throughout your development routine. Don't worry about your bad English. We don't judge any kind of grammar or language structure. However, it is important to make sure that each sentence you write is easily understandable and has an exact atomic meaning without ambiguity.

## Git commit messages

Keep your commit messages follow the styles below to improve readability and consistency. Generally there are two acceptable styles of commit message.

### commit type: what you did in prese

Refer to [here](http://karma-runner.github.io/0.10/dev/git-commit-msg.html) and [here](https://seesparkbox.com/foundry/semantic_commit_messages) for more information.

**Available types**

- chore (updating grunt tasks etc; no production code change)
- docs (changes to documentation)
- feat (new feature)
- fix (bug fix)
- refactor (refactoring production code)
